My name is Surita B and this is my diary. My day started
like any other day, I rolled out of bed and put 36 pairs of shoes on.
I'm a centipede. Which is why the other insects at school don't allow me to play football with them.
They say I give very good hugs though and most days I feel like that's the most important thing.
Today was not one of these days.
